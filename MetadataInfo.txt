MAIN INFO OF THE METADATA PROVIDED BY NOAA ABOUT THE PREDICTION DATA 

These data depict the potential inundation of coastal areas resulting from current Mean Higher High Water (MHHW) conditions. The process used
to produce the data can be described as a modified bathtub approach that attempts to account for both local/regional tidal variability as
well as hydrological connectivity. The process uses two source datasets to derive the final inundation rasters and polygons and accompanying
low-lying polygons: the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the area and a tidal surface model that represents spatial tidal variability. The
tidal model is created using the NOAA National Geodetic Survey's VDATUM datum transformation software (http://vdatum.noaa.gov) in conjunction
with spatial interpolation/extrapolation methods and represents the MHHW tidal datum in orthometric values (North American Vertical Datum
of 1988).

These data illustrate the scale of potential flooding, not the exact location, and do not account for erosion, subsidence, or future construction.
Inundation is shown as it would appear during the highest high tides (excludes wind driven tides) with the sea level rise amount. These data should be
used only as a screening-level tool for management decisions. As with all remotely sensed data, all features should be verified with a site visit. The
dataset is provided "as is," without warranty to its performance, merchantable state, or fitness for any particular purpose. The entire risk associated
with the results and performance of this dataset is assumed by the user. This dataset should be used strictly as a planning reference and not for
navigation, permitting, or other legal purposes.
