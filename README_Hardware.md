# Hardware Report 
### Bill of Materials 

MATLAB Software - $0 OR $100 maximum (there are other packages for $20, $30, $40, etc.)
    - if you have a license through an institution. Without a license given by an institution, the version you will need if MATLAB_R2022b or newer.
Elevation Data Files & Data Server - $0
Prediction Data File - $0 

### Device Requirements 

You will need a device that has <strong>32 GB RAM memory.</strong>
This is becayse the datasets are so large that the device that you run the final function on will not be able to process this much data unless it has 16 GB RAM or more. Ideal amount would be 32 GB RAM, but a 16 GB RAM works as well. If your MatLab software crashes after a few times running the script, reopen MatLab and run it again. This will not change anything, it just means that your device is struggling to process the amount of data ran through multiple times.
