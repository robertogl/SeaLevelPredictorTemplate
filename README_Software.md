# Software Installation & Code
## Installation Process

The software required to run this code is MATLAB_R2022b or any newer version of MatLab. First, you will have to download the correct prediction data file which is linked in this repository under the folder named "data". Then, you will need to download every code file under the folder named "insert name".

Once all the MatLab ".m" files are downloaded to your device and opened in your MatLab window, you will need to also import the prediction data file (that you have already downloaded to your device) into your MatLab folder where you are going to run the files for this project. The specific folder in your MatLab window is not important - the only requirement is that you have all the data files and script files in the same folder when you run the final function script.
